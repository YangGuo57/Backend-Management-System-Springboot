### /controller

This package contains the `UserController` class, which is part of the Controller layer in MVC. Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, perform operations via services, and return responses.

#### UserController.java

### /mapper

This package contains interfaces for MyBatis \ tool to map objects to database operations. `UserMapper` would be an interface defining operations for user data that can be automatically implemented by the ORM framework.

#### UserMapper.java - interface

### /pojo

POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object. The classes here (`Article`, `Category`, `Result`, `User`) represent the data structure that will be used across the application without business logic.

#### Article.java

#### Category.java

#### Result.java

#### User.java

### /service

This package would contain interfaces and classes defining the business logic of the application. `UserService` would define the contract for user-related operations, which the implementation (in the `impl` sub-package) would fulfill.

#### /impl/

##### UserSercviceImpl.java

### UserService.java - interface

### /utils

This package contains utility classes like `Md5Util` which provide generic functionality that can be used across the application.

#### Md5Util.java

## ManagementEventApplication

The main application class that would start the entire Spring Boot application.



# Annotations

## Controller

### **@RestController**

**Description**: This annotation is used at the class level and denotes a special controller that handles HTTP requests. `@RestController` simplifies the development of RESTful web services by combining `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning the data returned by each method is written directly to the body of the response in a format like JSON or XML.

```java
@RestController
public class GreetingController {
    
    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String sendGreeting() {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

### **@RequestMapping**

**Description**: Applied at the class or method level to define routing information. It can specify the URL, HTTP method, and other request parameters. When used at the class level, it sets a base path for all resource URLs in the controller.

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {
    
    @GetMapping("/{userId}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable String userId) {
        // Logic to fetch and return the user by userId
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/")
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User newUser) {
        // Logic to create a new user
    }
}
```

### **@GetMapping**

**Description**: A shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)` that is only used at the method level. It indicates that a method should be used to handle a GET request for a specific URL.

```java
@RestController
public class BookController {
    
    @GetMapping("/books/{bookId}")
    public Book getBookDetail(@PathVariable String bookId) {
        // Logic to fetch and return the book details by bookId
    }
}
```

### **@PostMapping**

**Description**: `@PostMapping` is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)`. It is specifically designed to handle HTTP POST requests, making it ideal for creating resources or submitting data to be processed.

```java
@RestController
public class RegistrationController {
    
    @PostMapping("/register")
    public User registerUser(@RequestBody User newUser) {
        // Logic to register a new user
        // This might involve saving the user to a database and returning the saved entity
        return newUser; // This is a simplified example. In practice, you would return the saved user object.
    }
}
```
